# Use "Frame" and Shared States to Organize A System  

## Problems of Organizing A System

In the development of software systems, there is usually a requirement to allow the communication between different components. Obviously, this is not a new problem, and many strategies have been used to build the communication, including the design of a common accessible communication center, and the construction of explicit communicating channel between the according components. Note that,
communication is also possible if one component has direct access to the other component, and this kind of access can be guaranteed with intermediate relations if all components are organized in a structure.  

To organize the components, the simplest structure is probably the tree-like structure.

As shown above, "Frame" only works in building the tree-like structures.If the desired system has a structure much different from a tree, using "Frame" without adjustments may not save the effort.
