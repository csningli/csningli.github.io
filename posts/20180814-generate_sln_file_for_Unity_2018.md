# Generate sln File for Unity 2018
When editing Unity scripts in the external editor, it makes the work much more convenient if the editor can do auto-completion.For this purpose, we need the solution file (.sln file).

In Unity 2018, the .sln file will be automatically generated when you perform Assets -> Open C# Project", <b>IF</b> the external scripts editor has been set to "Visual Studio".

The solution has been tested in Unity 2018.2.2f1 .
