# Load and Switch Scenes in CocosCreator

In CocosCreator, if you want to change to the scene described in a .fire file,  use following code to the job.   

    cc.director.load("scene")

Here "scene" is the name of the .fire file. That is, you should already have scene.fire in the assets directory.
